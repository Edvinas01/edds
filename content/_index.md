This is a site where I write about tech, non tech stuff, personal projects and alike. Basically things I find interesting. Checkout the links scattered around this page, you might find something interesting.

At the moment I'm writing a blog, [check it out](/blog "Blog").

### About
My name is Edvinas Daneviƒçius. I'm a developer who loves JVM and its ecosystem. I mostly write back-end applications with Java and or Kotlin. However from time to time I dip my nose into front-end and game development as well.

I like clean, structured and tested code. Static analysis and automation tools which help me to stay on this track are my best friends.

### Other
If you have some suggestions or just want to chat, contact me via one of the emails I use on [GitHub](https://github.com/Edvinas01 "My GitHub profile").
