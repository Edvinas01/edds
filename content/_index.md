This is a site where I write about tech, non tech stuff, personal projects and
alike. Basically things I find interesting. Checkout the links scattered around
this page, you might find something interesting.

At the moment I'm writing a blog, [check it out](/blog "Blog").

### About
My name is Edvinas Danevičius (or Edd, hence the site name). I'm a developer
who loves JVM and its ecosystem. I mostly write back-end applications with Java
and or Kotlin. However from time to time I dip my nose into front-end and game
development as well.

I like clean, structured and tested code. Static analysis and automation tools
which help me to stay on this track are my best friends.
