Hello there stranger, glad that you came by. What is this you might be
thinking, well this is a site where I write about things that I find
interesting or fun, that's pretty much it.

If you're interested in how this site is built, you can find the source

### About
I'm a developer who loves JVM and its ecosystem. I mostly work with
back-end applications though from time to time I dip my nose into
front-end and game development as well.

### Blog
Currently I'm writing a small blog, [check it out]({{< ref "blog" >}}).
