### Intro
Pancakes are one of my favorite dishes. I drink a lot of tea and find pancakes with tea to be a perfect combination. Here I present my recipe for making dry pancakes.

### Recipe
Prepare the following ingredients:
* 2 eggs.
* Spoonful of sugar.
* Pinch of salt.
* 1 cup of flour.
* 1 cup of water.
* Some butter or oil.

### Steps
After the ingredients are ready, prepare the dough:

1. Mix the eggs, sugar and salt.
2. Add half cup of water and mix again.
3. Start slowly pouring flour while mixing everything.
4. Add the remaining water and mix again.

The resulting dough should not be too thick - like a liquid. If the dough is thick, add more water.

The next step is cooking:

1. Heat up the pan and add some butter or oil. If adding butter, do not add too much and also make sure the pan is not too hot.
2. Once the pan is hot, pour some dough right in the middle of the pan, distribute the dough throughout the pan by lifting the pan and tilting. If the dough does not distribute nicely - its too thick, add more water.
3. Cook one side for 1 minute, once it gets a nice brownish color, flip the pancake.
4. Cook the other side for 1 minute until it gets a brownish color as well. While it is cooking, twist the pancake with one arm.
5. Do this until there is no more dough. Also for the final pancake, make sure not to use too much dough - split it up into smaller pancakes if that is the case.

### Result

The resulting pancakes should be dry and stiff and will go really nicely with tea. Optionally smearing the pancakes with mashed bananas or jelly and then rolling them will be more nutritious. At this point I usually combine them with whatever sweet I can find in my home.
