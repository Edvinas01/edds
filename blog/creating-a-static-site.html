I wanted something simple, really
lightweight and with least amounts of JavaScript. After doing some research, I found that its
not that simple to achieve given the current state of the web (specially the JavaScript
part).</p><p>Why avoid JavaScript you might wonder? During browsing I block JavaScript on most sites and
also set add-block and browser to aggressive privacy modes. Due to this, some sites become
unusable. I don't want to bother my readers with these issues.</p><p>Anyway, to begin with I set the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Avoid external dependencies such as CDNs, images and etc.</li><li>Use JavaScript only if necessary.</li><li>Minify <code>.html</code>, <code>.css</code>, <code>.js</code>.</li><li>Use a template engine when building the site.</li><li>Automate deployments.</li></ul><footer>Contact me via <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Edvinas01">GitHub</a>.</footer></article></main></body></html>
